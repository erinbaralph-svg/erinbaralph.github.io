    descriptionParagraphs: [
      "In the summer of 2024, I worked as a Collections Assistant at the Uxbridge Historical Centre. My main responsibility was a large-scale project involving the cleaning and reorganization of the attic in one of the Centre’s historic buildings. Through this work, I gained hands-on experience in deaccessioning, condition reporting, cataloguing, inventory management, proper storage, and safe disposal practices. I used Excel and museum collections management software to document artifacts and maintain accurate records, while following conservation and safety standards throughout the project.",
